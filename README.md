A combination of excel formulas and manipulations were used, for example, descriptive statics to run an analysis between successful and failed statistics

Secondly, it was imperetive to analyze outcomes from from a monthly perspective and how each campaign performed. Shown in the results is the results from launch date.

###### Outcomes Based on Launch Date conclusion
Drawn from the results in Outcomes Based on Launch Date, campaigns that performed the best were launched in the spring and summer. Particularly May and June. Although there are are more successful campaigns in the months of July and October, they are also the months with the highest number of failed campaigns. Overall, the failure rate is lower than than the success rate.

###### Outcomes Based on Goals conclusion
It seems as if the Kickstarter campaigns that started with a smaller goal performed better than those that started with too large of a goal. We start to see balance with the the more midlevel goals between $35,000 and $45,000
## Summary of limitations
###### Data is Too General
It would be interesting to view data on specific cities rather than country. For example, a campaign launched in New York City would probably fare better than one launched in Valparaiso, Indiana
